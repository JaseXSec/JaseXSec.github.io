# 📝 Obsidian Writing Workspace

This is your personal writing workspace for creating blog posts and project write-ups.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **`01-Drafts/`** - Work in progress posts
- **`02-Published/`** - Completed posts (backup)
- **`03-Assets/`** - Images and media for your posts
- **`00-Templates/`** - Templates for new posts

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Create new post** in `01-Drafts/`
2. **Use templates** from `00-Templates/` for front matter
3. **Add images** using `![[image.png]]` syntax
4. **Convert & publish** using `simple-convert.bat` in the main directory

## 📝 Writing Tips

- Use `![[image.png]]` for images (they'll be converted automatically)
- Add proper front matter at the top of each post
- Keep images organized in `03-Assets/` by post name
- Use descriptive filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md`
