            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Jase, a cybersecurity student and IT professional with a deep interest in offensive security, threat hunting, and digital forensics. I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to understand systems from the inside out.</p>
            
            <p>I enjoy building tools, solving puzzles, and participating in red team exercises. I'm also passionate about automating security workflows and sharing knowledge through tutorials and write-ups.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy reading sci-fi, tinkering with hardware, gaming, and weightlifting.</p>
